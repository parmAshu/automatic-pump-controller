status- under development; first prototype tested successfully

GENERAL INFORMATION -

With increasing population, resources are more limited than ever bofore. Fresh water is one such resource that needs judicial use. In India, water is stored in overhead tanks which are filled using the fresh water lines on a periodic basis. Often, pumps are kept on until tanks
start overflowing. This process not only wastes a large amount of water but also causes electricity wastage (another precious resource). 

This device provides a solution to the problem. Pumps can be attached to the device along with level sensing probes which are mouted inside 
the tank. Once the device is started it keeps pump switched on until the tank is filled upto a certain level, then, the device turns off the
pump and the itself. Thus, the device consumes no energy when not operational.
