# GENERAL INFORMATION -

With increasing population, resources are more limited than before. Fresh water is one resource that needs judicial use. In India, water is stored in overhead tanks which are periodically filled using the municipal corporation fresh water lines. Often, due to carelessness pumps are left switched on which leads to wastage of water and energy (another precious resource).

This device provides a solution to the problem. Pumps can be wired to this device along with level sensing probes which are mouted inside 
the tank. Once the device is turned on, it keeps the pump switched on until the tank is filled upto a certain level, after which it turns 
off the pump and itself. Thus, the device consumes no energy when not operational.
